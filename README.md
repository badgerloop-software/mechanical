For the Mech team

This repository is for any mechanical team related code/calculations to help with version control and keeping things up to date.

Examples of code to upload here would be: pod run profile, kinematic analysis, structural analysis, etc.

Most files will likely be Python, MATLAB, or EES but use whatever language is easiest. 

For a tutorial on how to use git, see this: https://github.com/badgerloop-software/github-tutorial-template
